Generated Comment: Hey there! I totally understand the confusion around MMPROJ files and running AI models.  
While I might not have specific information on MMPROJ files, I recently created a video titled "How to
Run Local AI Models - in 5 minutes" that covers the basics of running local AI models, which might help you
get started! You can check it out here:

I hope it provides some useful insights, and if you have any questions after watching, feel free to ask!
